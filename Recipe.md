This is the recipe of Vanila Cake:-

Step 1: Make The Batter
Before you make the batter, make sure all the cold ingredients have been brought to room temperature. This is vital for getting the ingredients to emulsify properly. Mixing room temperature ingredients with cold ingredients will cause the batter to curdle.




Next preheat the oven for about 30 minutes before you plan to make the cake. This will ensure the oven is up to temperature.

When it comes to mixing the ingredients for the batter, mix the oil, butter, and sugar together for a full 5 minutes. This aerates the mixture which helps produce a light, fluffy cake texture.

Beat in the eggs one at a time, allowing each one to incorporate before adding the next one. Then, beat in the vanilla.

Sift or whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together. I like sifting because this aerates the flour, removes clumps, and ensures the baking powder is evenly distributed.

Add half the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix until almost fully combined. Then mix in all the buttermilk. Finally, mix in the remaining flour.

Don't over mix here. You only want to mix just until no streaks of dry flour are visible. Overmixing will ruin the texture of the cake.

Step 2: Bake The Cake
Divide the vanilla cake batter evenly between two 9-inch round cake pans.

The pans should be well greased and lined with parchment paper cut to fit the bottom. Use bake-even strips around the pans for even baking.

Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs attached. You don't want the toothpick to be completely clean because that means the cake is overbaked and will be dry.

How To Frost A Layer Cake
Place the first layer upright on a cake stand or serving platter. Spread ⅓ of the frosting over the top of the layer. The vanilla buttercream in the recipe below yields 4 cups of frosting.




Instead of measuring it out, I smooth the frosting evenly in the bottom of the mixing bowl. Then I use a spatula to divide it into 3 equal portions. Fewer dishes to mess up and it doesn't have to be 100% precise.

Place the top layer bottom side up over the frosted bottom layer. Use ⅓ of the frosting to cover the top of that layer. Finally, use the remaining ⅓ to cover the sides of the entire cake.




Swoop the frosting like I did, or use a cake scraper to smooth it out. If you wish to pipe designs on the cake, you'll need to increase the recipe by 1.5 times. The recipe as is makes just enough frosting to cover the cake.

I opted to keep it simple and added a few fancy sprinkles to the top.
