Oil: I highly recommend canola or vegetable oil but any flavorless oil will work. The oil plays an important role in the cake's moisture.
Butter: The butter adds a slight richness and moistness to the cake. Use unsalted butter so you can control the amount of salt that goes into the recipe.
Sugar: Granulated white sugar is the only sugar I recommend for a successful cake. It adds sweetness and aids in keeping the cake moist.
Eggs: The eggs provide structure. They help hold the cake together. They're also a fat, which also adds to the moisture.
Vanilla: I strongly recommend using vanilla bean paste. The flavor is unmatched.
Flour: Cake flour is the only flour I suggest. Its low protein content will prevent too much gluten from developing and in turn yields the softest, tenderest texture.
Baking powder: Baking powder is used for leavening. Look for one that is aluminum-free. Baking powders that contain aluminum will sometimes have a metallic taste.
Salt: Regular table salt is all I typically use for baking.
Buttermilk: Buttermilk is essential to the cake's texture. Whole milk or any milk alternatives will not provide the same results.



To make this vanilla cake you'll need:

9-inch round pans: Use aluminum baking pans! These pans allow the batter to "climb" the walls of the pan so the layers bake up tall. Avoid any and all pans that are nonstick when baking cakes!!
Bake-even strips: I swear by bake-even strips. They are cloth strips that you soak in water and wrap around the cake pans. They promote even cooking so the layers bake up moist and level.
Mixer: I always use a stand mixer with a paddle attachment.
